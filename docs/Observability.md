# Observability

Knowing "what works" and "what doesn't" and if so "why" is a crucial part of any software delivery.

The [Observability and Performance](https://pages.github.tools.sap/observability/) product Area as part of the SAP BTP provides relevant technologies to help all people involved in the software delivery to:

1. Store related observability telemetry data in excellent technology (backed by leading open source and 3rd party vendors).
2. Offer matching APIs and UIs to slice and dice the data lake for numerous possible use cases on top.

To learn what features and functionalities the Observability can deliver as well in your service, don't miss to browse the [Open Demonstrator](https://pages.github.tools.sap/observability/learning/).

To quickly start with observability for your application, go to the [Observability Jumpstart](https://pages.github.tools.sap/observability/jumpstart/) page. There a service team can find relevant pointers how to onboarding their services and where to get started.
