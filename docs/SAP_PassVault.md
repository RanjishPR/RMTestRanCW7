SAP PassVault is an application that helps you store credentials that a team of people need to access, such as passwords for technical users, in a secure way.

If you are working in a team and want to create a productive application, it is recommended at SAP to create a SAP PassVault group to store the credentials of your technical users.

Alternatively, if you just want to do the tutorial on your own you can store the passwords in your local password manager.
