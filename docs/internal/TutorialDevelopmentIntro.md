# Introduction to Tutorial Development

The tutorial is stored in a GitHub repository and consists of two parts that go together:

1. *Documentation*: Stored as markdown (MD) files in the `master` branch that explain what needs to be done, including code snippets.
2. *Example Code*: The resulting code for each module of the tutorial is stored in a separate branch. The code snippets in the documentation should exactly describe how to get from the previous example to the resulting code of the module.

## Distribution List

There's a distribution list to reach out to the tutorial development team:

* [DL CPES Tutorial Team](mailto:DL CPES Tutorial Team)

## Planning and Bug Tracking

There are two projects:

| Project                                                                            | Description                               |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| [Tutorial Road Map](https://github.tools.sap/orgs/CPES/projects/2) | Tutorial development road map             |
| [Tutorial Issues](https://github.tools.sap/orgs/CPES/projects/3)   | Issues with the documentation, code, etc. |
| [UA Tasks](https://github.tools.sap/orgs/CPES/projects/4)          | Tasks for UA team                          |


When people open a new issue, they aren't automatically assigned to a project. Therefore, we need to watch for new issues without project assignment:

* [Issues w/o Project Assignment](https://github.tools.sap/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+repo%3ACPES%2FCPAppDevelopment+repo%3ACPES%2FCPAppDevelopment-dev+repo%3ACPES%2FAppDevelopment-val+no%3Aproject)
