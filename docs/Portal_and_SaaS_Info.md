# Portal and SaaS (SAP internal)

This part of the tutorial is about how to use the application created in [Create a CAP-Based Application](Create-CAP-Application.md) with the SAP BTP Portal service, and how to create a *subscribable application* (aka "SaaS" = "Software-as-a-Service") out of it.

It is only intended for SAP internal development tools, as the portal service is not available to customers any longer. A new version for external and internal developers is in development and will be based on the [Launchpad Service](Launchpad-Service.md).

## Prerequisites

You need to complete the following tutorials to do proceed with the tutorials of the *Portal and SaaS* part:

1. All tutorials in [Create a CAP-Based Application](Create-CAP-Application.md)
2. [Prepare SAP BTP and Cloud Foundry](Prepare-BTP.md)
3. [Set Up the SAP HANA Cloud Service](HANA-Cloud-Setup.md)
4. [Prepare User Authentication and Authorization (XSUAA) Setup](Prepare-XSUAA.md)
